  "description": "This dataset features DCA licenses that have been revoked.</br></p>\r\n\r\nLicenses can be suspended or revoked for several reasons including, an order by the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings; non-payment of fines and/or fees; or not maintaining a license requirement such as a current driver\u2019s license or insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nLicenses are typically surrendered when a business closes, changes ownership, changes location, changes business name, or discontinues the activity that required the license.</br>\r\n\r\nLicenses can be reinstated based on appeal of a revocation, expiration of a suspension, or new application after surrendering it.</br>\r\n\r\nEach record in the dataset represents a time that a license was revoked, suspended, surrendered, or reinstated so a license can appear more than once.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be linked to other DCA datasets using the DCA License Number column. This dataset cannot be linked to an administrative hearing decision or provide a specific reason for the change in status.",
