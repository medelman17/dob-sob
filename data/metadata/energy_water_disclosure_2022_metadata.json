      "description": "Property IDs are unique identifiers for your property that can be used by EPA, you, or other organizations to track and manage your property. There are four main types of Property IDs: Portfolio Manager Property IDs - This is a unique ID assigned by EPA to each property. Portfolio Manager Parent Property IDs - If your property is a campus of buildings and you benchmark one or more \"\"child\"\" buildings individually, then each child building will be associated to its parent through this ID. Custom IDs - A custom ID is an ID that you can set, for example, it could be an ID associated with your company or an ID for a campaign in which you are participating. When you enter a Custom ID, you can enter both a name for the ID and its actual value. For example: (Company ABC Inventory ID, 01234). When you search for these custom IDs in reports, you will see them only as Custom ID 1, Custom ID 2, and Custom ID 3, because Custom ID 1 could be different for different properties in your portfolio. Standard IDs - A standard ID is a special type of ID with a set name that is available within Portfolio Manager. These are IDs associated with local legislation, national campaigns, or other large benchmarking activities. For example, New York City uses the Borough Block and Lot (BBL) number to track buildings in their jurisdiction. To enter a standard ID you can select the ID name from our dropdown list and then enter the value. See Standard ID for a full list.",

Your Score is based on your specific Use Details (Number of Workers, Computers, etc) and you need to update your Use Details to accurately reflect the activity at your property.  Your occupancy could affect your eligibility for ENERGY STAR certification.

If you have a 10-story building, and on average one floor is vacant, and the other 9 floors fully leased and occupied, then the occupancy would be 90%. If you have people working on all floors/areas of your building, then you are 100% occupied. You do not need to count empty cubicles or the number of employees who enter a property. Hotel: Occupancy is a measure of the rooms that are sold. If you have a hotel with 100 rooms, and on average 10 rooms per night are vacant, then the occupancy is 90%. Multifamily: Occupancy is a measure of the units that are leased. If you have a 100 apartments, and 5 are vacant for the year, then the occupancy is 95%. Worship Facility: Occupancy is the percentage of the building that is operational, regardless of how many people are in the building. Most of the time, this will be 100%.

The ENERGY STAR scores are based on data from national building energy consumption surveys, and this allows Portfolio Manager to control for key variables affecting a building\u2019s energy performance, including climate, hours of operation, and building size. What this means is that buildings from around the country, with different operating parameters and subject to different weather patterns, can be compared side-by-side in order to see how they stack up in terms of energy performance. The specific factors that are included in this normalization (Hours, Workers, Climate, etc) will depend on the property type.  The 1-100 scale is set so that 1 represents the worst performing buildings and 100 represents the best performing buildings. A score of 50 indicates that a building is performing at the national median, taking into account its size, location, and operating parameters. A score of 75 indicates that a property is performing in the 75th percentile and may be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR Certification.  ENERGY STAR Scores are available for many property types.  The 1-100 scale is based on the country in which your property is located. Properties in the US are compared to the national population of properties in the US. Similarly, properties in Canada are compared to the national population of properties in Canada. At this time there are no ENERGY STAR scores specifically developed for other countries. Therefore, properties located in other countries will be compared to the US national population, by default.",

This means the National Median is normalized to account for your property's weather, business activity, and fuel mix. Using the National Median Source EUI, Portfolio Manager computes other National Median metrics like National Median Site EUI, National Median Energy Cost, and National Median GHG Emissions. If your property has multiple scorable property types \u2013 the National Median is a calculated average based on the proportions of the National Medians of each property type (as calculated above). If your property has both scorable and non-scorable property types (Office & Restaurant) - the National Median is based only on the scorable property type. If your property does not have an ENERGY STAR score - The National Median is the Source EUI from CBECS, normalized for your property's specific fuel mix, but not normalization for either weather or business operations. Using the National Median Source EUI, Portfolio Manager computes other National Median metrics like National Median Site EUI, National Median Energy Cost, and National Median GHG Emissions. If a property has multiple non-scorable property types (Social Hall 70%, Food Service 30%) \u2013 the National Median for comparison is the \u201cPortfolio Manager-Calculated Property Type\u201d (which is the property type that is over 51% of the GFA, in this example it would be Social Hall). If your property doesn\u2019t have a single property type that is 51% or more - your National Median for comparison is the \u201cMixed Use\u201d property type from CBECS.",

      "description": "Green Power is a generic term for renewable energy sources and specific clean energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions relative to other sources of energy that supply the electric grid. You may use green power directly from an on-site renewable system, or you may purchase green power from your utility or independent green power supplier. In order for power to be considered green, you must own what are called the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), or the legal claims/rights to the environmental benefits of the green power. These rights can be sold separately from the actual electricity (kWh). Therefore, please note the following distinction between Onsite and Offsite Green Power: Onsite Green Power \u2013 Power generated from an onsite renewable system. The only types of onsite green power currently tracked in Portfolio Manager are solar and wind power. Energy use from these systems is green only if you retain the rights to the RECs associated with the power generated by your system. If you sell the RECs (for example, through REC arbitrage), then you do not have onsite green power. Offsite Green Power \u2013 Green power purchases from your utility and/or independent purchases of RECs. If through utility purchases you acquire both electricity (kWh) and RECs, then you have the right to the Green Power. If you purchase your electricity (kWh) from your utility but your RECs from another provider, then you may attribute these RECs to your utility power. Offsite Green power sources in Portfolio Manager include Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biogas (Landfill gas), Biomass, and Small Hydropower.",

      "description": "Green Power is a generic term for renewable energy sources and specific clean energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions relative to other sources of energy that supply the electric grid. You may use green power directly from an on-site renewable system, or you may purchase green power from your utility or independent green power supplier. In order for power to be considered green, you must own what are called the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), or the legal claims/rights to the environmental benefits of the green power. These rights can be sold separately from the actual electricity (kWh). Therefore, please note the following distinction between Onsite and Offsite Green Power: Onsite Green Power \u2013 Power generated from an onsite renewable system. The only types of onsite green power currently tracked in Portfolio Manager are solar and wind power. Energy use from these systems is green only if you retain the rights to the RECs associated with the power generated by your system. If you sell the RECs (for example, through REC arbitrage), then you do not have onsite green power. Offsite Green Power \u2013 Green power purchases from your utility and/or independent purchases of RECs. If through utility purchases you acquire both electricity (kWh) and RECs, then you have the right to the Green Power. If you purchase your electricity (kWh) from your utility but your RECs from another provider, then you may attribute these RECs to your utility power. Offsite Green power sources in Portfolio Manager include Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biogas (Landfill gas), Biomass, and Small Hydropower.",

Depending on which above type you have, your exact GFA is determined differently: \u201cSingle buildings\u201d and \u201ccampuses of buildings\u201d measure the GFA between the outside surface of the exterior walls of the building(s). This includes all areas inside the building(s) including supporting areas. GFA is not the same as rentable space, but rather includes all area inside the building(s). Include in GFA: lobbies, tenant areas, common areas, meeting rooms, break rooms, atriums (count the base level only), restrooms, elevator shafts, stairwells, mechanical equipment areas, basements, storage rooms. Do not include in GFA: exterior spaces, balconies, patios, exterior loading docks, driveways, covered walkways, outdoor play courts (tennis, basketball, etc.), parking (How to enter parking?), the interstitial plenum space between floors (which house pipes and ventilation), crawl spaces. Although you do not include these areas in your GFA, you do include their energy use. Our algorithms assume buildings have outdoor usage, too. The GFA refers specifically to interior space. But, the energy use evaluated should be all the energy required to operate your building, which includes the energy used both inside and out. You may exclude the GFA of certain Property Uses, if they meet these 4 criteria (see this FAQ for details): The Property Use is less than 10% of the building\u2019s GFA The Property Use is not a property type eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score The Property Use is sub-metered so that both the Property Use\u2019s energy consumption and GFA can be excluded The Property Use\u2019s energy use patterns are significantly different than those of the rest of the building (ex: A cell phone tower on a building) \u201cParts of a building,\u201d such as tenant spaces, measure the GFA of the \u201cusable square feet.\u201d Usable square feet include the specific area the tenant occupies to do business.

      "description": "\"IT Energy is the amount of energy required by the server racks, storage silos, and other IT equipment in the Data Center. IT Energy is a measure of energy (i.e. kWh), it should not be reported as an instantaneous reading of electric demand.  IT Energy may be measured at any of 4 locations: Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Output (required for a score, in most cases) Power Distribution Unit (PDU) Input PDU Output Server/Equipment Input IT Energy meters permit readings for a user-determined time period (e.g. weekly, monthly, or quarterly). Monthly measurements are recommended, on schedule with utility readings, if possible.  In order to receive an ENERGY STAR score, the IT energy must be measured at the UPS Output. However, you may track IT energy at the other measurement locations for your own purposes. A measurement of IT Energy from the UPS Output is consistent with a Category 1 measurement of data center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), as recommended by EPA and other leading organizations. In the following circumstances only, EPA will permit alternate measurement approaches based on the IT configuration: Data Centers that do not have a UPS are permitted to supply readings from the input to the PDU. Data Centers for which more than 10% of the UPS load is directed to non-IT (e.g. mechanical) equipment are required to provide a reading that excludes the non-IT equipment. Two options are permitted: If energy used by non-IT equipment is measured, then you can subtract the non-IT energy from the total UPS energy, and enter the remainder into your UPS Output Meter. If energy used by non-IT equipment is not measured, then you can supply a reading from the input to the PDU that supports the IT equipment.\"",

Your Weekly Operating Hours are the total number of hours per week where the majority of workers are present. For example, if the majority of workers are in your building from 8:00 am - 6:00 pm M-F, then your Weekly operating hours should be 50 (10 hrs * 5 days per week). If you have two or more tenants with hours that differ by more than 10%, then you should enter two separate Property Uses so that you can track them separately. If you have two or more tenants with hours that differ by less than 10%, use the largest tenant\u2019s hours (based on Gross Floor Area). If your hours vary seasonally (ex: 1/2 day Fridays in the summer), use the schedule that is followed most often. If you have 2 shifts of workers, add the hours for both shifts. Do NOT count these hours: When the property is occupied only by maintenance, security, the cleaning crew, or other support personnel. HVAC startup or shutdown time Properties that serve the Public (retail stores, medical office, bank branch, courthouse, library, health club, etc). Your Weekly Operating Hours should be the hours that you are open to the public. Worship Facility. Your Weekly Operating Hours should reflect hours when the facility is typically open for operation, which may include worship services, choir practice, administrative use, committee meetings, classes, or other activities.\"",

Depending on which above type you have, your exact GFA is determined differently: \u201cSingle buildings\u201d and \u201ccampuses of buildings\u201d measure the GFA between the outside surface of the exterior walls of the building(s). This includes all areas inside the building(s) including supporting areas. GFA is not the same as rentable space, but rather includes all area inside the building(s). Include in GFA: lobbies, tenant areas, common areas, meeting rooms, break rooms, atriums (count the base level only), restrooms, elevator shafts, stairwells, mechanical equipment areas, basements, storage rooms. Do not include in GFA: exterior spaces, balconies, patios, exterior loading docks, driveways, covered walkways, outdoor play courts (tennis, basketball, etc.), parking (How to enter parking?), the interstitial plenum space between floors (which house pipes and ventilation), crawl spaces. Although you do not include these areas in your GFA, you do include their energy use. Our algorithms assume buildings have outdoor usage, too. The GFA refers specifically to interior space. But, the energy use evaluated should be all the energy required to operate your building, which includes the energy used both inside and out. You may exclude the GFA of certain Property Uses, if they meet these 4 criteria (see this FAQ for details): The Property Use is less than 10% of the building\u2019s GFA The Property Use is not a property type eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score The Property Use is sub-metered so that both the Property Use\u2019s energy consumption and GFA can be excluded The Property Use\u2019s energy use patterns are significantly different than those of the rest of the building (ex: A cell phone tower on a building) \u201cParts of a building,\u201d such as tenant spaces, measure the GFA of the \u201cusable square feet.\u201d Usable square feet include the specific area the tenant occupies to do business.

Your Weekly Operating Hours are the total number of hours per week where the majority of workers are present. For example, if the majority of workers are in your building from 8:00 am - 6:00 pm M-F, then your Weekly operating hours should be 50 (10 hrs * 5 days per week). If you have two or more tenants with hours that differ by more than 10%, then you should enter two separate Property Uses so that you can track them separately. If you have two or more tenants with hours that differ by less than 10%, use the largest tenant\u2019s hours (based on Gross Floor Area). If your hours vary seasonally (ex: 1/2 day Fridays in the summer), use the schedule that is followed most often. If you have 2 shifts of workers, add the hours for both shifts. Do NOT count these hours: When the property is occupied only by maintenance, security, the cleaning crew, or other support personnel. HVAC startup or shutdown time Properties that serve the Public (retail stores, medical office, bank branch, courthouse, library, health club, etc). Your Weekly Operating Hours should be the hours that you are open to the public. Worship Facility. Your Weekly Operating Hours should reflect hours when the facility is typically open for operation, which may include worship services, choir practice, administrative use, committee meetings, classes, or other activities.\"",

In addition, please note these specific property type considerations: Multifamily Housing \u2013 The Total Number of Residential Living Units should count all individual private apartments/condominiums. There are three additional Property Use Details, which break this total into three different categories, according to building height. If your property has only one building, or if all buildings are of the same height, then you should enter \u201czero\u201d for the other two categories. Portfolio Manager requires that the sum of these three values equal your Total Number of Residential Living Units: Number of Residential Living Units in a Low-rise (1-4 stories) \u2013 This includes all units located in an individual building that is 1 to 4 stories in height. Number of Residential Living Units in a Mid-rise (5-9 stories) \u2013This includes all units located in an individual building that is 5 to 9 stories in height. Number of Residential Living Units in a High-rise (10 or more stories) \u2013 This includes all units located in an individual building that is 10 or more stories in height. Senior Living Communities - For communities where residents have individual rooms that open onto central corridors, each room is considered a single unit, even if there are two or more beds per room. For communities with apartment-type living units each apartment is considered a single unit. Do not count individual rooms within apartments or townhouses.\"",

The following options are available: No specific resident population: The property is not inhabited by any dedicated population. Dedicated Student: Privately owned, off-campus housing -- not affiliated with a college or university -- that is primarily occupied by undergraduate or graduate students. Dedicated Military: Off-base housing primarily occupied by persons serving in or employed by the military. Dedicated Senior/Independent Living: Housing that is restricted to the elderly that also provides limited programs of assistance with domestic activities (meals, housekeeping, activities, transportation, etc.). Typically, a unit in an Independent Living Community resembles a standard market unit, though the community may offer amenities or communal dining facilities not typical in multifamily apartment buildings.  Independent Living Communities generally are not licensed and generally do not provide assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) or healthcare, such as the management of medications and assistance with bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating, eating and other similar activities.

Depending on which above type you have, your exact GFA is determined differently: \u201cSingle buildings\u201d and \u201ccampuses of buildings\u201d measure the GFA between the outside surface of the exterior walls of the building(s). This includes all areas inside the building(s) including supporting areas. GFA is not the same as rentable space, but rather includes all area inside the building(s). Include in GFA: lobbies, tenant areas, common areas, meeting rooms, break rooms, atriums (count the base level only), restrooms, elevator shafts, stairwells, mechanical equipment areas, basements, storage rooms. Do not include in GFA: exterior spaces, balconies, patios, exterior loading docks, driveways, covered walkways, outdoor play courts (tennis, basketball, etc.), parking (How to enter parking?), the interstitial plenum space between floors (which house pipes and ventilation), crawl spaces. Although you do not include these areas in your GFA, you do include their energy use. Our algorithms assume buildings have outdoor usage, too. The GFA refers specifically to interior space. But, the energy use evaluated should be all the energy required to operate your building, which includes the energy used both inside and out. You may exclude the GFA of certain Property Uses, if they meet these 4 criteria (see this FAQ for details): The Property Use is less than 10% of the building\u2019s GFA The Property Use is not a property type eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score The Property Use is sub-metered so that both the Property Use\u2019s energy consumption and GFA can be excluded The Property Use\u2019s energy use patterns are significantly different than those of the rest of the building (ex: A cell phone tower on a building) \u201cParts of a building,\u201d such as tenant spaces, measure the GFA of the \u201cusable square feet.\u201d Usable square feet include the specific area the tenant occupies to do business.

If you have two or more tenants with hours that differ by less than 10%, use the largest tenant\u2019s hours (based on Gross Floor Area). If your hours vary seasonally (ex: 1/2 day Fridays in the summer), use the schedule that is followed most often. If you have 2 shifts of workers, add the hours for both shifts.
