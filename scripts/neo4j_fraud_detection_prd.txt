# NYC DOB Fraud Detection Platform - Neo4j Implementation PRD

## Project Overview
Transform the dob-sob fraud detection platform to leverage Neo4j as the primary graph database for detecting sophisticated fraud patterns in NYC's construction industry. Focus on relationship analysis, network detection, and temporal pattern recognition using the existing 94 datasets totaling 25GB of NYC DOB data.

## Strategic Pivot: Neo4j-First Architecture

(:Violation {violation_id, violation_type, issue_date, severity})
(:Inspection {inspection_id, inspection_type, date, result})
(:Financial {transaction_id, amount, fee_type, payment_date})

// Core relationship types
(:Person)-[:LICENSED_FOR]->(:LicenseType)
(:Person)-[:OWNS]->(:Property)
(:Person)-[:FILED]->(:Job)
(:Job)-[:AT_PROPERTY]->(:Property)
(:Violation)-[:ISSUED_TO]->(:Property)
