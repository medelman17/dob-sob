- 1,050+ professional-to-application relationships

## 🔍 Fraud Detection Capabilities

### 1. Shell Company Detection

**Identifies properties with multiple violations across different datasets**

**Key Findings:**

- Properties with 29-47 violations identified
- Cross-referencing DOB and ECB violations
- Geographic clustering in Manhattan (Borough 1)

**Top Risk Properties:**

- BIN 1035393: 35 East 45th Street (47 violations)
- BIN 1024812: 1633 Broadway (44 violations)
- BIN 1024686: 1481 Broadway (35 violations)

### 2. ECB Respondent Network Analysis

**Tracks entities with multiple ECB violations across properties**

**Key Findings:**

- Department of Education: 27 violations across 15 properties
- N Tech Design of America: 10 violations across 3 properties
- Park Management USA Corp: 9 violations across 3 properties

**Pattern:** Government entities and management companies show high violation counts, indicating potential systemic issues.

### 3. Professional Network Analysis

**Identifies professionals filing multiple applications**

**Key Findings:**

- Walid Abdulla (PE): 15 applications across 9 properties
- Daniel Dunzik (RA): 9 applications across 9 properties
- Hugo Subotovsky (RA): 8 applications across 8 properties

**Pattern:** Some professionals are highly active, potentially indicating legitimate high-volume practices or suspicious coordination.

### 4. Cross-Dataset Fraud Patterns

**Correlates violations with job applications by same owners**

**Key Findings:**

- Ridgewood Tower LLC: 2 violations + 2 job applications
- Generate Hudson Solar LLC: 1 violation + 1 job application
- Starwood Group LLC: 1 violation + 1 job application

**Pattern:** Owners with both violations and active construction work may indicate ongoing compliance issues.

### 5. Geographic Risk Analysis

**Violation density by borough**

**Key Findings:**

- Manhattan (Borough 1): 1.93 violations per property (highest volume)
- Queens (Borough 4): 1.51 violations per property
- Brooklyn (Borough 3): 1.40 violations per property
- Bronx (Borough 2): 1.27 violations per property

### 6. Financial Impact Analysis

**ECB penalty analysis by violation type**

**Key Findings:**

- Construction violations: 783 cases, avg $1,422 penalty
- Quality of Life violations: 10 cases, avg $8,125 penalty (highest)
- Local Law violations: 32 cases, avg $2,012 penalty
- Elevator violations: 94 cases, avg $1,196 penalty

## 🚀 Technical Achievements

### Data Quality:

- Automatic date format conversion (YYYYMMDD → YYYY-MM-DD)
- NaN value handling and data cleaning
- Property deduplication via BIN matching
- Relationship integrity maintenance

## 🎯 Fraud Detection Algorithms

### 1. **Shell Company Risk Score**

```cypher
// Properties with multiple violation types
MATCH (p:Property)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:VIOLATION_AT]-(dob:Violation)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:VIOLATION_AT]-(ecb:ECB_Violation)
WITH p, count(dob) + count(ecb) as total_violations
WHERE total_violations >= threshold
RETURN p, total_violations
```

### 2. **Network Centrality Analysis**

```cypher
// Professionals/Respondents with high property counts
MATCH (entity)-[rel]->(target)
WITH entity, count(DISTINCT target) as connections
WHERE connections >= threshold
RETURN entity, connections
```

### 3. **Cross-Dataset Correlation**

```cypher
// Owners with both violations and active construction
MATCH (o:Owner)-[:OWNS]->(p:Property)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:VIOLATION_AT]-(v)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)<-[:JOB_APPLICATION_AT]-(j)
WITH o, count(v) as violations, count(j) as jobs
WHERE violations > 0 AND jobs > 0
RETURN o, violations, jobs
```

## 📈 Scalability Demonstrated

### Current Scale:

- **Total Records**: 13,000+ across all datasets
- **Total Relationships**: 15,000+
